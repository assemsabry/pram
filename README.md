# Planetary Recognition and Analysis Model (PRAM): A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Exoplanet Detection

## Abstract

The Planetary Recognition and Analysis Model (PRAM) represents a breakthrough in automated exoplanet detection, combining advanced machine learning techniques with comprehensive astronomical data analysis. This paper presents a unified deep learning framework that integrates data from multiple space missions (Kepler, TESS, K2) to achieve superior accuracy in exoplanet classification. PRAM employs an ensemble approach combining XGBoost gradient boosting with deep neural networks, enhanced by sophisticated feature engineering and class imbalance handling techniques. The model achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score exceeding 0.92, demonstrating exceptional performance in distinguishing confirmed exoplanets from false positives across diverse planetary systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The discovery and characterization of exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of planetary formation and the potential for life beyond Earth. Since the first confirmed exoplanet detection in 1992, over 5,000 exoplanets have been discovered, with thousands more candidates awaiting confirmation. The exponential growth in exoplanet data from space missions such as Kepler, TESS, and K2 has created an unprecedented opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to automate and enhance the detection process.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional exoplanet detection methods rely heavily on manual analysis of transit light curves and follow-up observations, which are time-intensive and resource-limited. The increasing volume of astronomical data necessitates automated systems capable of:
- Rapidly processing large datasets from multiple missions
- Distinguishing genuine exoplanet signals from astrophysical false positives
- Providing confidence metrics for follow-up observations
- Adapting to different observational conditions and stellar types

### 1.3 Objectives

The primary objectives of PRAM are:
1. Develop a unified model capable of processing data from multiple space missions
2. Achieve superior classification accuracy compared to existing methods
3. Provide interpretable confidence metrics for scientific decision-making
4. Enable rapid processing of large-scale astronomical datasets
